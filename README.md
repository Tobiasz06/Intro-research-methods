# The project
This project looks at how slang is used differently in two book genres. By checking out a bunch of books from each genre, the studie will take a look at how often and in what ways slang is used. The goal is to figure out how authors use slang to make their stories feel real, develop characters, and set the scene. This study will help show the unique language styles and choices that make each genre stand out.

# Background information
The studie has various background research done on a more broad spectrum of this topic. The first studie done is: "The words of slang: themes and development". This studie was done by the Oxford academic. The second source is specified on the Dutch language, it is an article about how youth always plays with language creating new words. This source is called: "From Dickens to the Digital Age: The Evolving Use of Slang in Literature" and it's written by the Gilliam writing group.


# Research question and hypothesis
The research question for this study is: Is there a difference in the frequency of slang usage in romantic books and young adult books? For this research question the hypothesis is: Young adult fiction books will have a relatively higher frequency of slang usage compared to historical fiction books.

# Method
To answer the research question data from project gutenberg will be collected. This will be done by selecting a representative sample of books from the romantic genre and the young adult genre available on Project Gutenberg. Each genre will have the same amount of books as data to ensure the comparison will be reasonable.
To identify slang a list of words that are identified as slang will be used to go through all the text and mark all slang words. The frequency will be specified as slang terms per 1000 words.
When both genres have a slang to 1000 word ratio a comparison can be made and a conclusion on the research question.
