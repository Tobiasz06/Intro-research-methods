## The project
This project looks into how slang is used in two different book genres. By going through a selection of books from each genre, the study will check how often and in what ways slang is used. The goal is to figure out how authors use slang to make their stories feel realistic, develop characters, and create a specific atmosphere. This research will help show the unique language styles that make each genre stand out.

## Background information
The studie has various background research done on a more broad spectrum of this topic. The first source is "The words of slang: themes and development", a study done by Oxford academic. The second source focuses on how language and slang evolves within literature. This second source, "From Dickens to the Digital Age: The Evolving Use of Slang in Literature" is written by the Gilliam writing group.

## Research question and hypothesis
The research question for this study is: Is there a difference in the frequency of slang usage in romantic books compared to young adult books? The hypothesis is that young adult fiction books will have a relatively higher frequency of slang usage compared to historical fiction books.

## Method
To answer the research question data from project gutenberg will be collected. A sample of books from the historical genre and the young adult genre will be chosen, with the same number of books from each genre to keep the comparison fair. A list of slang words will be used to go through the text and mark all the slang. The slang frequency will be calculated as the number of slang words per 1,000 words. Once the slang-to-word ratios for both genres are calculated, they will be compared to draw conclusions about the research question.
