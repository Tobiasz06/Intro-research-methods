# Intro-research-methods
The project:
This project looks at how slang is used differently in two book genres. By checking out a bunch of books from each genre, the studie will take a look at how often and in what ways slang is used. The goal is to figure out how authors use slang to make their stories feel real, develop characters, and set the scene. This study will help show the unique language styles and choices that make each genre stand out.

Background information:
The studie has various background research done on a more broad spectrum of this topic. The first studie done is: "The words of slang: themes and development". This studie was done by the Oxford academic. The second source is specified on the Dutch language, it is an article about how youth always plays with language creating new words.
